## Misconceptions On Arting Comics

When people think of opprotunities to draw comics, people initially think of having a script writer handing you a full script, and then going by those instructions.

But for indie comic creators, this is rarely how it works in practice. Those of us who need writers have to develop our own story to draw to submit to a magazine. in my case that quickly becomes an entire writing career.

I suspect the reason for the misconception is much of the comics industry is based around corporate comics, where there is very little creativity in terms of story development, and you use inhouse characters.

But in Indie comics, generally the person who writes the story also draws the story. And the creator isnt always necessarily trained in ivy leage schools, or studied Michaelangelo.

In general I tend to write a complete short story before I even begin script writing, then adapt that short story into a full script. That script then turns into a storyboard. And finally the storyboard is turned into comic art.

If anyone tells you that isnt how things work, theyre lying to you and actively trying to destroy your career in the comic industry.
